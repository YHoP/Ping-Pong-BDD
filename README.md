# Ping-Pong-BDD

Ping-Pong with BDD
Recreate the Ping-Pong application using BDD. <br>
It should have a method that accepts a number and returns a list of numbers and Strings that correspond to the Ping-Pong solution. This time, have the method return an ArrayList (i.e app.pingPong(7) returns [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7]). <br>
The Ping-Pong method counts from 1 to a given number. For example, we expect an input of 2 to return the ArrayList [1, 2].
