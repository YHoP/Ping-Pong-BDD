Ping-Pong with BDD
To start off our first week of Java, we are going to recreate the Ping-Pong application using BDD. It should have a method that accepts a number and returns a list of numbers and Strings that correspond to the Ping-Pong solution. This time, have the method return an ArrayList (i.e app.pingPong(7) returns [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7]).

Start off by writing plain English versions of your specs, in the order you'd implement them. Here is the first one to get you started: "The Ping-Pong method counts from 1 to a given number. For example, we expect an input of 2 to return the ArrayList [1, 2].

Have a teacher check your plain English versions before you start any coding. Then, remember to write the JUnit spec for the simplest behavior, implement it, refactor, and then start again with the next spec.
